# Alphabet Prediction
This is funny project!
</br>
It works as you can see, we enter one letter then it predict what is next.
</br></br>
Example:
</br>
input: "c" => output: "d"
</br></br>
I implemented this project by RNN with one time step, as you may know, this is simple ANN! (because of time step value)
</br></br>
Good luck :)
